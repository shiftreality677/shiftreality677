👋 Hi, I'm @shiftreality677.
👀 I'm deeply fascinated by the world of virtual and augmented reality. Exploring immersive experiences and pushing the boundaries of reality through technology excites me.
🌱 Currently, I'm on a learning journey to master Unity and Unreal Engine, honing my skills in 3D modeling and animation, and diving into spatial computing.
💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that involve creating VR/AR experiences, interactive simulations, or pushing the limits of mixed reality applications. I'm open to working with creative minds and tech enthusiasts who share the same passion.
📫 You can reach out to me via email
